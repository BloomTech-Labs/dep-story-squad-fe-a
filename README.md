## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/ZKcMrW3P/story-squad-a-jean)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Story-Squad-Roadmap-2682f21ae48b420cbb0caafa3f500b5e)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/WaHXdLK2NASoFWYVMZLVNt/Story_Squad?node-id=57%3A8)


Welcome to Story Squad! We are an interactive learning platform targeted at grade school children, and we help build reading comprehension as well as artistic, writing, and analytical/critical thinking skills through weekly competitions.

Each week features a new chapter in an exciting novel, written and serialized specifically for Story Squad by author and educator Graig Peterson. Children are provided with prompts based on the chapter they've just read, and participants are then divided into teams of two. Students create art and fanfiction to match the prompt, before going head to head in a bracket-style tournament.

In addition to growing their literary and artistic skills, students learn team building and critical thinking skills through a unique voting system, where each child must weight their own work against their teammate in order to increase their odds of winning. Badges and points incentivize winning and encourage participation.

Story Squad is a paid service; parents are required to create the account for their children and pay a monthly subscription fee in order for their children to compete. This brings the platform into compliance with COPPA and ensures a long future for the project.

# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |
